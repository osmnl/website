To make clear which map layers are allowed for usage with OpenStreetMap editing, Allroads made a small map showing layers and their licences.

The map shows layers where there are agreements for and layers in the Public Domain.
Just a small remark: the AHN layers are **ONLY** available with a **personal license** (More information on the [forum](https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=649579#p649579) (in Dutch)).

More information (in Dutch) is also available on the [forum](https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=66737).
