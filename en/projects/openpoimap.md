OpenPoiMap is a user-friendly tool to find designated tags/POIs on OpenStreetMap.
There is a choice of a large part of the map features defined in the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features#Amenity).

By clicking on a point, tags become visible, including references to the wiki.

The tool is available on [openpoimap.nl](http://openpoimap.nl)
